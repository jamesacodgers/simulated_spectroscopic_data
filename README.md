# Simulated Spectroscopic Data

This was code used to simulate spectra used to test the AcRoPLS algroithm (github.com/ckappatou/AcRoPLS). 
The code simulates spectra as linear combinations of set spcetra, as would be generated by Beer-Lambert's law (wikipedia.org/wiki/Beer-Lambert_law) with a log transform.
For this code the spectra were chosen randomly from a gaussian process prior. 

Several parameters are available to tune the correlations of different spectra and introcuce variang numbers of both discreate and continuos soces of interference. 

The code was designed to be run in matlab blocks using the delimiter # %%
to separate blocks. This was done with the intention of allowing users to experiment with different parameters for simulated spectra. 

The output of this code is a set of spectra with associated concentrations and interferences  which is saved to a .csv file.
